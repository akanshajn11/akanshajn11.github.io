This is my first blog. I would like to share my experience, knowledge and work through my blogs. In this blog, I would like to share my journey in programming so far and my transition from Web to Android.

## Recession Rumours

In school, I was deeply involved in programming and loved to code small programs in Java, the first language I learnt.  It helped me understand Object-oriented programming. However, in 2011, when I had to join college, IT industry was rumoured to have a recession in the near future and fear of not getting a job made me choose Electronics and Communications over Computer Science Engineering. It turned out that the rumours were fake, so I continued following my interest in programming and started learning Computer Science part time. 

## First Job

In 2015, the part time learnings led me to my first job from campus placements in a Service-based IT company as a Junior Software Engineer. As part of the onboarding process, I had to join a pre-defined Bootcamp program in Microsoft .NET technology. For new joiners, there was no option to pick a desired technology so I was left with the only option of dropping Java again.  After the Bootcamp, I was assigned to a .NET MVC project. Being in the same company for the last 5.5 years, I got opportunities to work on several  projects that made me transition to different technologies like Angular, Docker containers and SQL database programming. Even without prior experience in any of them, I successfully delivered good work, earned appreciation and got promoted as well. Even after all this recognition and progress, I could still feel that something was missing. In retrospect, I realised that I was walking on someone else's path. 

## The Turning Point

I figured out that I wanted to use my skills to build and contribute to something more impactful and satisfying. I wanted to learn something new and something useful. So I researched about the booming technologies and considering the fact that people are using their mobile phones all the time, I thought mobile development is the way to go. I chose Android over iOS because of my familiarity with Java. So I set a roadmap to become an Android Developer and started training myself through online courses. In a short period of time, after seeing my code running on my own device, I got obsessed with Android Development. I have built multiple apps over the last one year and I still feel that I have just scratched the surface, indeed there is a long way to go. Following this path, I really felt that I achieved something because I believe that just walking on the path designed by someone else for their requirements is not an achievement. Achievement is creating your own path, walking on it and then succeeding in it.

## The Road Ahead

Of-course I faced a lot of difficulties in switching technology but taking the first step is the hardest. However, if your vision is clear and the steps you take are aligned with it, it gradually becomes easier. I have chosen my way towards Android and I am truly excited to explore this journey further. I will be sharing this journey through my upcoming blogs and I really hope you like it ðŸ™‚

Thanks for reading.
